## 📊 How It Works
The Airline Passenger Forecasting tool uses various classical time series models, including:

- **Holt-Winters**: This method accounts for seasonal trends and helps improve accuracy.
- **ARIMA**: A powerful modeling technique for understanding and forecasting time series data.
- **SARIMAX**: An extension of ARIMA that includes seasonal effects and exogenous variables, if applicable.

The application analyzes historical data to identify patterns and generate forecasts for future airline passengers.
