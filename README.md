# ✈️ **Airline Passenger Demand Forecasting using Time Series Models**

</div>

---

## 🧩 **Project Overview**

This project focuses on forecasting **monthly airline passenger traffic** using historical data that exhibits clear **trend** and **seasonality** patterns.  
By leveraging statistical time series models, the goal is to predict future passenger volumes to assist in **capacity planning**, **resource allocation**, and **strategic decision-making** for airline operations.  

Three forecasting models are implemented and compared — **Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing**, **ARIMA**, and **SARIMAX** — to determine which provides the most accurate and stable forecasts.

---

## 🎯 **Objectives**

- Analyze and visualize monthly airline passenger trends and seasonality  
- Build and tune Holt-Winters, ARIMA, and SARIMAX forecasting models  
- Compare model accuracy and evaluate forecasting performance  
- Predict future passenger demand and visualize forecast intervals  
- Interpret findings for actionable insights in airline planning  

---

## ⚙️ **Key Methods**

1. **Time Series Decomposition** – To separate trend, seasonality, and residual components  
2. **Stationarity Testing** – Using Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test  
3. **Model Fitting & Parameter Selection** – Grid search for ARIMA/SARIMAX hyperparameters  
4. **Forecast Evaluation** – Based on metrics such as RMSE, MAPE, and AIC  
5. **Visualization** – Forecast plots with confidence intervals to interpret results

## 📈 **Model Insights and Comparison**

This section summarizes the performance evaluation of the three forecasting models — **Holt-Winters**, **ARIMA**, and **SARIMAX** — applied to the airline passengers dataset.

---

### ✳️ **1. Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing Forecast**

#### **Key Insights**
- Successfully captured both **trend** and **seasonality** in the data.  
- Forecasted values closely matched the **true test data**, especially during **seasonal peaks**.  
- Slight **underestimation at troughs** but strong overall alignment.  
- Ideal for datasets with **multiplicative seasonality**.

#### **Model Performance**
- **MAE:** `10.30`  
- **RMSE:** `15.81`

> ✅ **Conclusion:**  
Holt-Winters achieved the **lowest error** and provided the most accurate forecast.  
It serves as the **best-performing baseline model** for this dataset.

---

### ⚙️ **2. ARIMA Forecast**

#### **Key Insights**
- Accurately modeled the **overall upward trend** but **failed to capture seasonality**.  
- Forecasted curve appeared **too smooth**, missing periodic peaks and dips.  
- Unsuitable for datasets with **strong seasonal patterns**.

#### **Model Performance**
- **MAE:** `41.83`  
- **RMSE:** `55.22`

> ⚠️ **Conclusion:**  
ARIMA is **ineffective for seasonal datasets**; forecasts lacked seasonal structure and had high error values.

---

### 🌦️ **3. SARIMAX Forecast**

#### **Key Insights**
- Captured both **trend** and **seasonality** accurately.  
- Forecasts aligned closely with the actual data across the entire test set.  
- More robust than ARIMA, allowing inclusion of **exogenous regressors**.  

#### **Model Performance**
- **MAE:** `13.99`  
- **RMSE:** `17.20`

> ✅ **Conclusion:**  
SARIMAX produced **reliable and stable forecasts**, effectively modeling seasonal patterns with slightly higher complexity.

## 🏆 **5. Final Conclusion & Recommendations**

- **Best Model:** 🥇 **Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing**  
  - Lowest RMSE (`15.81`), best alignment with actual values, interpretable, and simple to implement.  
- **Runner-Up:** 🥈 **SARIMAX**  
  - Nearly as accurate, highly flexible, and suitable for advanced forecasting with external features.  
- **Least Effective:** 🚫 **ARIMA**  
  - Poor at modeling seasonal data and resulted in the highest RMSE (`55.22`).

> **Final Takeaway:**  
For datasets with **strong trend and seasonality**,  
- Use **Holt-Winters** for simplicity and accuracy.  
- Choose **SARIMAX** for complex scenarios or inclusion of external variables.  
- Avoid **ARIMA** unless data is non-seasonal or stationarized.
